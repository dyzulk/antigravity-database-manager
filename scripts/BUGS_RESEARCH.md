## Bug #1 — IDE Update Index Wipe

The most commonly reported bug. Both internal indices (`ChatSessionStore.index` and `trajectorySummaries`) are silently reset to empty during or immediately after an IDE version update.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Updating the IDE to a new version (v1.18.x → v1.19.x, v1.20.x, etc.) |
| **Symptoms** | All conversations vanish from the sidebar immediately after update. `.pb` files remain on disk untouched. |
| **Root Cause** | The IDE's update migration pipeline does not preserve the `state.vscdb` key `chat.ChatSessionStore.index` — it re-initializes to `{"version":1,"entries":{}}`. The Protobuf `trajectorySummaries` blob is also zeroed. |
| **Our Fix** | Full 6-phase recovery pipeline scans `.pb` files, extracts titles from brain artifacts, and rebuilds both indices byte-accurately. |

## Bug #2 — Power Outage / Unclean Shutdown Corruption

The IDE performs a non-atomic flush of its two indices during shutdown. If the process is interrupted, the indices are written in an inconsistent state.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Power outage, SIGKILL, force-quit, OS crash, or any unclean IDE termination |
| **Symptoms** | Some or all conversations disappear. JSON index may be partially written (truncated JSON). Protobuf blob may be empty or contain orphaned entries. |
| **Root Cause** | The IDE writes `ChatSessionStore.index` and `trajectorySummaries` as separate, non-transactional SQLite updates. If the process dies between writes, one or both can be in an inconsistent state. |
| **Our Fix** | Recovery pipeline rebuilds both indices atomically from the source-of-truth `.pb` files. Diagnostic engine detects and repairs partial writes. |

## Bug #3 — Workspace Rebinding / Project Switch Loss

Conversations are scoped to workspace URIs. When a project folder is moved, renamed, or re-opened via a different path, the workspace URI changes and previously-bound conversations become orphaned.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Moving project folder, opening via different path, drive letter change (e.g., `H:` vs `h:` on Windows) |
| **Symptoms** | Sidebar shows conversations from a different workspace or shows no conversations. Conversations still exist but are bound to the old workspace URI. |
| **Root Cause** | The `trajectorySummaries` Protobuf stores a `workspace_uri` inside Field 9 of each entry. When the URI changes, the IDE's renderer filters out entries that don't match the current workspace. On Windows, drive letter casing differences (`H:` vs `h:`) create a permanent mismatch. |
| **Our Fix** | `workspace migrate` subcommand rebinds all conversations from an old URI to a new one. Recovery pipeline normalizes drive letters to lowercase. |

## Bug #4 — SSH Remote Development Session Loss

Conversations created during SSH remote development sessions behave differently from local sessions and are frequently lost or invisible when switching between local and remote contexts.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Starting/stopping SSH remote sessions, switching between local and remote workspaces, remote server reboot |
| **Symptoms** | Conversations created in SSH sessions are invisible in local mode, and vice versa. Some conversations have workspace URIs prefixed with `vscode-remote://` which are unavailable locally. |
| **Root Cause** | The IDE stores remote workspace URIs as `vscode-remote://ssh-remote+host/path/to/project` which may not resolve when working locally. The `state.vscdb` may also be on the remote machine, not synced to local. |
| **Our Fix** | Full scan detects all `.pb` files regardless of workspace binding. `scan` subcommand reports workspace URI mismatches. `workspace migrate` can rebind remote URIs to local equivalents. |

## Bug #5 — Agent Manager UI Load Error Self-Deletion

The Agent Manager chat window "self-deletes" conversations when it encounters a load error, even though the underlying agent and conversation data survive in the workspace.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Agent Manager encounters a Protobuf parsing error, schema mismatch, or corrupted field during conversation load |
| **Symptoms** | Conversation tile disappears from the Agent Manager UI. Agent state files remain on disk. No user-facing error message — silent deletion. |
| **Root Cause** | The IDE's Protobuf parser silently discards entries it cannot decode rather than displaying an error. If a single field is malformed (e.g., Field 15 with invalid wire type), the entire entry is dropped from the rendered list. |
| **Our Fix** | Diagnostic engine performs byte-level Protobuf validation to detect ghost bytes, invalid wire types, and field ordering issues. Repair engine autonomously fixes malformed entries. Recovery pipeline re-creates clean Protobuf entries from the `.pb` source data. |

## Bug #6 — Protobuf Field Ordering / Schema Conflict

The IDE's strict `ChatSessionStore` Protobuf parser expects fields in ascending tag number order. If fields are written out of order (e.g., Field 10 before Field 9), the entire entry is silently rejected.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Recovery tools or manual database edits that write Protobuf fields in non-canonical order |
| **Symptoms** | Conversations appear recovered in the JSON index but remain invisible in the sidebar. `trajectorySummaries` contains entries that pass basic validation but fail the IDE's strict parser. |
| **Root Cause** | The IDE's native parser does not implement the Protobuf specification's "fields may appear in any order" rule. Instead, it uses a strict ascending-tag parser that rejects out-of-order fields. Our prior recovery version had Field 10 (last_accessed) emitted before Field 9 (workspace). |
| **Our Fix** | Protobuf encoder (`protobuf.py`) recursively sorts all fields by ascending tag number before serialization. Diagnostic engine validates tag ordering. |

## Bug #7 — Windows Path Casing Mismatch

On Windows, drive letters in workspace URIs can be uppercase (`H:`) or lowercase (`h:`), creating a string-level mismatch even though the paths resolve to the same location.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Different tools or sessions opening the same project with different drive letter casing (e.g., `H:\project` vs `h:\project`) |
| **Symptoms** | History appears for some sessions but not others. `workspace list` shows duplicate entries for the same physical folder. Conversations are split across different workspace bindings. |
| **Root Cause** | The IDE stores workspace URIs as verbatim strings with no normalization. `file:///H:/project` and `file:///h:/project` are treated as completely different workspaces. |
| **Our Fix** | `build_workspace_dict` enforces lowercase drive letters in all generated URIs. Workspace migration consolidates duplicate entries. |

## Bug #8 — Long-Context Conversation Truncation

Extended, deep-context conversations (multi-day agentic sessions with hundreds of steps) can exceed internal buffer limits, causing the conversation to become partially or fully unrenderable in the UI.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Conversations with 100+ agent steps, large tool outputs, or extended multi-day sessions |
| **Symptoms** | Conversation loads but shows only the first N messages, or fails to load entirely with a blank chat window. The `.pb` file is large (10+ MB) and intact. |
| **Root Cause** | Backend UI rendering cannot process extremely large Protobuf payloads. The sidebar's trajectory summary may also have truncated or zero step counts, causing the IDE to skip the entry. |
| **Our Fix** | Recovery injects accurate step counts from `.pb` file analysis. Health check reports conversation sizes. Diagnostic engine flags entries with suspicious zero-step counts. |

## Bug #9 — Ghost Bytes and Double-Wrapping Corruption

The `trajectorySummaries` Protobuf blob can accumulate structural corruptions: ghost bytes (U+FFFD replacement characters), double-wrapped Field 1 entries, or orphaned padding where the Field 1 tag consumes the entire entry with no payload.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Repeated recovery attempts, non-atomic writes during crashes, character encoding mismatches during IDE updates |
| **Symptoms** | Recovery appears to succeed but conversations still don't appear. Database contains entries but the IDE's parser rejects them silently. |
| **Root Cause** | UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding boundaries can inject replacement characters (U+FFFD) into the binary Protobuf blob. Double-wrapping occurs when a previous recovery tool wraps an already-valid Field 1 entry inside another Field 1, creating a nested structure the IDE cannot parse. |
| **Our Fix** | Universal Corruption Diagnostic Engine performs byte-level scanning for ghost bytes, double-wrapping, UUID mismatches, and invalid wire types. Autonomous Repair Engine strips corruptions and rebuilds clean entries. |

## Bug #10 — `storage.json` / Protobuf Index Desynchronization

The IDE maintains three parallel data structures — `storage.json`, the JSON index, and the Protobuf blob — that can fall out of sync with each other, causing inconsistent state.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Partial writes, concurrent access, IDE crashes mid-operation, or manual database editing |
| **Symptoms** | Conversations appear in the sidebar but load as blank. Or conversations have titles in the sidebar but no workspace binding. Or `storage.json` references conversations that don't exist in the Protobuf index. |
| **Root Cause** | The three data stores are updated independently without a single transaction boundary. A crash between any two writes leaves them out of sync. |
| **Our Fix** | `storage inspect` subcommand reports the state of `storage.json`. Health check cross-validates all three data stores. Recovery pipeline writes all indices atomically from a single source of truth (the `.pb` files). |

## Bug #11 — "Scratch" Session History Disabled After Upgrade

Conversations created in scratchpad / non-project contexts are completely inaccessible after upgrading from older IDE versions (e.g., v1.16.5 → v1.18.x+). The UI displays a red "disabled" icon next to the history panel.

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Upgrading from IDE versions ≤ v1.16.5 to v1.18.x or later |
| **Symptoms** | History panel shows a red "disabled" icon for scratch sessions. No conversations are accessible, even through the Agent Manager. `.pb` files exist on disk with valid data. |
| **Root Cause** | The v1.18.x update changed how workspace-less ("scratch") conversations are indexed. Conversations without a workspace binding are no longer rendered by the new UI. The migration pathway does not backfill workspace data for existing scratch conversations. |
| **Our Fix** | Recovery pipeline uses workspace auto-inference (parsing `file:///` URLs in brain artifacts) to retroactively bind orphaned conversations to the correct workspace. Interactive batch assignment handles unmapped conversations. |

## Technical Root Cause

All 11 bugs stem from the same fundamental architectural flaw: the IDE's failure to atomically manage its three internal state stores:

1. **`chat.ChatSessionStore.index`** (JSON) — Gets reset to `{"version":1,"entries":{}}` on failure
2. **`antigravityUnifiedStateSync.trajectorySummaries`** (Protobuf) — Loses UUID-to-conversation mappings
3. **`storage.json`** — Workspace binding metadata falls out of sync

The raw `.pb` data files at `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/` and brain artifacts at `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/` are **never affected**. This means the data is fully recoverable — which is exactly what this Database Manager does.
