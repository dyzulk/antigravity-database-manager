Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project exists to help the community work around a known bug in the Google Antigravity IDE. All contributions are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/ag-donald/Antigravity-Database-Manager/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - Your operating system and Python version
   - Antigravity IDE version
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Any error output from the script

### Suggesting Improvements

Open an issue with the `enhancement` label describing:
- What you'd like to see improved
- Why it would help others
- Any implementation ideas you have

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all modules pass syntax validation:
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile antigravity_database_manager.py
   python -c "from src.core.lifecycle import ApplicationContext"  # validates all src/ imports
   ```
5. Run the full test suite:
   ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
    ```
6. Test on your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
7. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add: description of change"`
8. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
9. Open a Pull Request

### Code Standards

- **Python 3.10+ compatibility**: Use `from __future__ import annotations` for modern type hints
- **Zero external dependencies**: Only standard library imports
- **Use the `Logger` class**: All console output must go through the unified `Logger` system
- **Error handling**: All I/O operations must be wrapped in `try/except` with descriptive error messages
- **Docstrings**: All public classes and methods must have docstrings
- **Module placement**: New features go in the appropriate `src/` module — see Project Structure below
